// Primary per-client limiter: keyed on the (rightmost XFF hop, CF-Connecting-IP)
// tuple via `getLoginRateLimitKey`, not the rightmost XFF hop alone. This
// deployment (usage.jays.services) is always fronted by Cloudflare in front
// of Render, so the rightmost XFF hop Render observes is Cloudflare's own
// egress IP - shared by every Cloudflare-proxied client, not a per-visitor
// address. CF-Connecting-IP is set by Cloudflare itself from the
// TLS-terminated connection and can't be forged by a client going through
// Cloudflare, so pairing it with the shared egress hop separates distinct
// CF-proxied clients back out again. See `getLoginRateLimitKey` in
// rate-limit.ts for the full rationale, including why this stays safe for
// traffic that reaches Render directly.

// Backstop keyed via `getLoginBackstopKey` - NOT an IP-independent global
// bucket, and NOT simply the rightmost XFF hop alone. A single source can
// fragment its own tuple key into many buckets by forging and rotating
// CF-Connecting-IP (see rate-limit.ts), so this backstop needs to
// re-aggregate by the one identity that source cannot spoof - but which
// identity is actually unspoofable depends on whether the request really
// transited Cloudflare. `getLoginBackstopKey` checks the rightmost hop
// against Cloudflare's published IP ranges to decide: for genuine
// Cloudflare-fronted traffic (this deployment's production topology) it
// keys per CF-Connecting-IP, so a burst of distinct CF-proxied clients
// hammering through the same shared Cloudflare egress IP each get their own
// bucket and cannot exhaust one shared pool to deny login to a different
// client, including the legitimate owner. Only for traffic that reaches
// Render directly (bypassing Cloudflare, where CF-Connecting-IP is just an
// ordinary spoofable header) does it fall back to the rightmost hop alone,
// re-aggregating that one peer's attempts regardless of how many tuple keys
// it produced. Same ~20/min budget the old global backstop used.
