/**
 * Per-call OpenRouter cost verification (DESIGN-usage-compliance-classifier §3c).
 *
 * Producers (Congress.Trade / Socratic.Trade) attach OpenRouter's generation id
 * to each pushed telemetry event as `providerRequestId`. This worker calls
 * `GET /api/v1/generation?id=<providerRequestId>` for a bounded batch of
 * not-yet-verified events, stores the provider's AUTHORITATIVE cost in
 * `verifiedCostUsd`, and compares it to the self-reported `costUsd` so drift
 * surfaces instead of being silently trusted.
 *
 * Bounded, idempotent, and safe to run every maintenance pass:
 *   - at most MAX_EVENTS_PER_PASS events per pass, deterministically ordered,
 *     with `truncated` reported so a backlog is visible rather than hidden;
 *   - network I/O happens OUTSIDE the single-writer admission lock (the same
 *     discipline alert-delivery uses) so verification can never stall ingest;
 *   - already-settled events ("match"/"discrepancy") are never re-fetched;
 *   - a transient failure records "error" and is retried on a later pass, up to
 *     MAX_VERIFICATION_ATTEMPTS, after which the event is parked in the
 *     TERMINAL "unverifiable" state so it can never be re-selected.
 *
 * The terminal state matters: "error" is a RETRYABLE status that the due-scan
 * selects. Parking an exhausted event as "error" would let it be picked up
 * forever — and because the exhausted marker is not an attempt marker, its
 * attempt counter would reset to 0 on every re-selection, yielding a permanent
 * 5-pass cycle. Since the scan is ordered oldest-first, a pile of permanently
 * dead ids (e.g. generations OpenRouter has pruned) would fill every batch and
 * starve newly-ingested events indefinitely while burning API calls.
