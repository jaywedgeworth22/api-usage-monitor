# Branch disposition audit — 2026-07-15 (MONET eval-sweep)

All 105 branches not merged into `main` (`36e6ac6`) by ancestry, classified at CONTENT level
(squash-merge aware: `gh pr view` head-SHA matching + `git cherry` + `diff main...` + board cross-ref).
Produced by a 15-agent read-only audit fan-out, verified 0 UNKNOWN verdicts; full evidence per branch
retained in the session transcript. Verdict counts: 71 CONTENT_MERGED / 17 SUPERSEDED / 10 STALE_ABANDONED / 7 UNLANDED_VALUABLE.

Safe-to-prune guidance: CONTENT_MERGED + SUPERSEDED + STALE_ABANDONED branches (98) can be deleted
(archive-first per fleet convention). The 7 UNLANDED_VALUABLE are being re-landed as fresh monet/* lanes
or filed as Planned board rows — see the effort board (2026-07-15 MONET reconciliation).
