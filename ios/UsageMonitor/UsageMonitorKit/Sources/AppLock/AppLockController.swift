/// The AppLock state machine. Owns the lock/unlock lifecycle and drives the
/// biometric prompt through an injected `AppLockAuthenticator`. Deliberately
/// free of any SwiftUI / LocalAuthentication import so it is unit-testable with
/// a stub authenticator; the `AppLockGate` view feeds it scene-phase events.
///
/// Design decisions:
///   - **Fail-closed default.** Starts `.locked` so content is never shown
///     before authentication when the feature is enabled.
///   - **Fail-open on `.unavailable`.** If the device can't evaluate any policy
///     (no passcode / no biometrics), we unlock rather than trap the user out
///     of a read-only monitor. The lock is only as strong as the device allows.
///   - **No re-prompt loop.** Automatic prompts fire only from `.locked`. A
///     `.failed` state (e.g. the user canceled Face ID) waits for an explicit
///     `retry()` tap instead of immediately re-presenting the system sheet.
